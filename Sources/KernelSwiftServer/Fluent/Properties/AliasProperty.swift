// MARK: - "Can be aliased" property capability

/// For the sake of excessive completeness (and, as an excuse, for consistency with Fluent's existing
/// plethora of "this property supports ..." protocols), this protocol provides the type-erased
/// version of ``AliasableProperty``, in the same way that `AnyProperty` is the type-erased
/// form of `Property`.
///
/// It is decidedly questionable whether this protocol serves any purpose whatsoever other than to
/// allow generically checking whether a given property can be aliased (which is itself of questionable
/// value, for that matter). Certainly the type-erased value accessors are pointless, as best I can
/// figure at the time of this writing (hopefully, I will be proven wrong eventually).
public protocol AnyAliasableProperty: FluentKit.AnyProperty {
    /// Type-erased form of ``AliasableProperty/wrappedValue``.
    var anyWrappedValue: Any { get }
    
    /// Type-erased form of ``AliasableProperty/projectedValue``.
    var anyProjectedValue: any AnyAliasableProperty { get }
}

/// A simple protocol to make a `Property`'s `projectedValue` and `wrappedValue` accessors
/// available generically.
///
/// The need for this is unfortunate, especially given that it's technically impossible for there
/// to be a property type that _isn't_ aliasable, but in a particularly convoluted twist of the rules
/// governing API breakage, `Property` can't be safely extended to add these accessors, with or without
/// FluentKit's cooperation - doing it from inside Fluent would be an API break due to the change in
/// conformance requirements, and extending it from outside Fluent doesn't correctly call into the
/// property's accessors (the generic defaulted implementations are always called) - and that in turn
/// bypasses the checks many property types perform in their `wrappedValue` getters, which makes some of
/// them behave unexpectedly. The only way out of this would be to have the ability to recognize property
/// wrappers via the typesystem (e.g. an implicit `PropertyWrapper` protocol, similar to `GlobalActor`),
/// which isn't going to happen, or to break public Fluent API.
public protocol AliasableProperty: AnyAliasableProperty, FluentKit.Property {
    /// A few of the property types don't follow the usual convention of returning `Value?` from their
    /// `value` accessors and `Value` from their ``wrappedValue`` accessors - in particular, `IDProperty`
    /// and `CompositeIDProperty` return the same type (with the same optionality) in both places, due to
    /// the convoluted semantics of a model's ID always being optional on the Swift side. Therefore we
    /// provide an `associatedtype` on the protocol, allowing the actual return type of the accessor,
    /// including the correct amount of optionality, to be inferred automatically by the compiler. The
    /// protocol is already non-existential anyhow, and aliasing only cares about knowing what the correct
    /// type is, not whether it matches up, so nothing is lost with this approach.
    associatedtype AliasedValueType: Codable
    
    /// An ``AliasableProperty``, like any property wrapper, has a ``wrappedValue``. The property wrapper's
    /// own `wrappedValue` accessor will automatically fulfill this protocol requirement, and the compiler
    /// will automatically infer ``AliasedValueType`` to be whatever the wrapper's accessor returned.
    var wrappedValue: AliasedValueType { get set }
    
    /// All Fluent property types are required to return `self` as their projected value, so we just require
    /// that ``projectedValue`` have `Self` as its type, which will always be correct for each property type.
    var projectedValue: Self { get }
}

/// ``AliasableProperty``s get automatic ``AnyAliasableProperty`` conformance by default.

}

/// A property wrapper which aliases a property to an existing FluentKit property
/// elsewhere on (or deeper within) the same model. Primarily useful for simplfying
/// access to the ID properties of a model using `@CompositeID`.
///
/// Example (with some boilerplate omitted):
/// ```swift
/// final class CompositeModel: Model, @unchecked Sendable {
///     final class IDValue: Fields, Hashable, @unchecked Sendable {
///         @Parent(key: "id") var parent: ParentModel
///         @Field(key: "index") var index: Int
///     }
///
///     @CompositeID var id: IDValue?
///
///     @Alias(of: \.$id.$parent) var parent: ParentModel
///     @Alias(of: \.$id.$index) var index: Int
/// }
/// ```
///
/// > Note: ``AliasProperty`` is unique among property wrappers intended for use with Fluent models
/// > in that it does not itself conform to `Property`, or even `AnyProperty`. This is a deliberate
/// > choice which prevents the presence of aliases from confusing Fluent's internal behavior, as it
/// > means they don't appear even in a model's `properties` array.
